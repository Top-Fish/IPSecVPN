This test case deals with an initiator that receives a notify from
a responder during the I1 state.
It should be logged, and the state should be deleted.
(WELL... Should it?  Should it try some more?  We can not be sure.
This test case should be improved...)

This test case shares 100% code with lp10-parentI2, and could be
merged into that directory.
