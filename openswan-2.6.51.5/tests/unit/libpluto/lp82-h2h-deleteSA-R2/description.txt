This test case is an IKEv2 Responder for the first SA, which then decides to
delete the child SA (before the other end).  To simulate behaviour of
Strongswan, this end is made to send out an INFO/D message with msgid of 0.

This uses the I1/R1/I2/R2/I3 pcap files from lp36 thru lp39.

The output packet of this test, the INFO/D message, will be sent to the next
test lp83.  Together the interaction is intended to look like this:

# NOTE: in the real exchange, the Initiator would first send out a
# CREATE_CHILD_SA, which is already tested for in other test cases.  Here, we
# skip negotiating CHILD SA #3, and skip directly to the Responder initiating
# the deletion of #2, which is what's being tested.
