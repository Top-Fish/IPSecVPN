This test case continues lp82, where the IKEv2 original Responder will delete a
child SA (before the original Initiator).  In this test case, we are the
Initiator and we will receive the request (from lp82) to delete the child SA
for the first time.

This test case bulds on lp82/lp83/lp84 where this transaction was successful.
Instead, lp85 simulates an encrypted request that cannot be handled, and a
failed notification is sent out to lp86.

This uses the I1/R1/I2/R2/I3 pcap files from lp36 thru lp39.  Some packets come
from lp82.

# skip negotiating CHILD SA #3, and skip directly to the Responder initiating
# the deletion of #2, which is what's being tested.
