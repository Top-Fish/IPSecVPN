This test case is an IKEv2 responder -- it uses a certificate with a wildcard
right= policy that accepts any ID that is properly validated.
This test case loads multiple conns with different names, and it should
bind only the conn that matches the actual name.

It is otherwise identical to lp17 and lp21, except it loads rw-carol and
rw-dave in order to cause "confusion".
