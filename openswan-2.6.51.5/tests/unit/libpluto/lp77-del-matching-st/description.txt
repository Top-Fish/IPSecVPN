This test cases constructs a (fake) state database with 2 families of SAs
(parent and child), which have icookie/rcookie that hash to the same bucket.

It then calls delete_state_family() on one of them.  We observe that only
one family is deleted.

This test cases uses h2hI3-statetable.c generated by lp75-alg-h2hI3.
