This test case is an IKEv2 responder -- it uses a certificate with a wildcard
right= policy that accepts any ID that is properly validated.

This is exactly like lp21-certreplyselfR2, and in fact starts out
identically, getting carol all hooked up, but then it accepts a packet
from *Dave*, and replies to it.
