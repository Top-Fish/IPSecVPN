This test case is an IKEv2 initiator.
In this test case, the policy is to permit an initiator from %any to propose
a tunnel to that end point (the /32).

This test case receives a second (I2) packet from the initiator, which is
where the CHILD SA policy is processed.  An associated lp14-initiatorany
test case sets up the PARENT SA policy.
