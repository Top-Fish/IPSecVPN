This test case starts pluto with a variety of different options, checking that it starts as expected.
In most cases, it starts pluto in the background, and then uses whack to tell it to shutdown.
Since pluto needs port 500/4500 (and 500 is privileged), most tests start it with another port, bound to 127.0.0.1,
that means that the default port selection code won't get tested here.
