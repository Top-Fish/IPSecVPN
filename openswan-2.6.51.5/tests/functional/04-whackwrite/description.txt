This test case parses a configuration file with readwriteconf, and then
emits a whackrecord file.  This is a purely functional test of the
code in readwriteconf, the contents of the whackrecord are not examined
here for consistency. A similar invocation is used in
     tests/unit/libpluto/lp02-0parentI1.
