This test exercises the configuration reading library present in
libipsecconf, and wrapped in the readwriteconf program.

h2h.conf was added as readwriteconf seemed to fail on it, but then it was
suspected that the problem was a lack of a trailing newline on the file,
so brokenspace.conf was added, only that did not trigger the fault.
