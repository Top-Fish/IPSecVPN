This directory contains scripts of various types.

---

Two scripts mimic certain KLIPS-only commands when using NETKEY. These may fold
back into the distribution later on, or get replaced by new code. Output is not
guaranteed to be identical to the KLIPS versions.

eroute: replacement for KLIPS' "ipsec eroute"
look: replacement for KLIPS' "ipsec look"

Install: replace the KLIPS script in /usr/local/libexec/ipsec/ with a
version from this directory.

pluto-log-merge.pl reads two log files output by OpenSWAN pluto daemon and
converts them into a chronologically ordered packet diagram.  See the online
help (--help).  Example execution using two log files for left and right:

   ./pluto-log-merge.pl --width 100 left.log right.log > merged.log

Several CPAN dependencies exist, whcih can be satisfied on a Debian based
system by running:

   apt install libterm-readkey-perl libscalar-list-utils-perl
