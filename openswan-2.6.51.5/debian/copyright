This package was debianized by Rene Mayrhofer <rene.mayrhofer@gibraltar.at> on
Thu, 10 Aug 2000 10:50:33 +0200.

The Debian package was created from scratch with some hints taken from
previous freeswan packages by Tommi Virtanen and Aaron Johnson.
The upstream software was originally downloaded from http://www.freeswan.org
while newer versions use the fork from http://www.openswan.org.
Debian packaging is Copyright © 2000-2010 Rene Mayrhofer.

Openswan derives its copyright from FreeS/WAN: Richard Guy Briggs
(KLIPS), D. Hugh Redelmeier (Pluto), Michael Richardson (technical lead,
KLIPS, testing, etc.), Henry Spencer (past technical lead, scripts,
libraries, packaging, etc.), Sandy Harris (documentation), Claudia
Schmeing (support, documentation), and Sam Sgro (support, releases).

After forking into Openswan, it is now Copyright © 2003-2018 Xelerance. All of
the code is DFSG-free.
